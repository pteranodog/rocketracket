# Rocket Racket
In Rocket Racket, between 6 and 50 friends will become members of 
NASA tasked with launching an extremely important mission. Your 
team, however, has been infiltrated with Russian Spies who will 
stop at nothing to prevent your rocket from getting off the ground.
Will NASA be able to select only their own members at the end of
the game, or will the Spies be able to successfully plant a bomb on
the rocket and infiltrate Mission Control to set it off?

## Rules:
- You ***may not*** show any other player your screen. Ever.
- Anybody can say anything at any time, as long as they follow the
previous rule.

## The Setup:
- First, gather a group of friends sized between 6 and 50 people.
If you are playing this while the COVID-19 pandemic is still going
strong, please plan accordingly and accomodate for social distancing
policies.
- Once you've gathered your group, go to the Rocket Racket website
on a device which will not be used by a player (preferably a device
with a large screen size) and select "Create Rocket." This will
create a new rocket, and a game code will be displayed on the screen.
- Using 3 to 5 other devices not being used by players (also with
screens that can be seen by multiple people at once), go to the
Rocket Racket website and select "Add Station." On this page, you
will be asked to enter a game code and select which station this
device will be. The five different stations are:
  - Mission Control
  - Launch Tower
  - Fueling Tanks
  - Crawler
  - Astronaut Complex
- It is recommended that all five stations are used, and that the
stations are spaced out in a large area so there is as little
interference between groups of people at their stations as possible.
- Once the rocket and the stations are set up, the players can go
to the website and select "I'm a Player." Each player will be asked
to enter their game code and will then be connected to the game.

## The Game:
During Rocket Racket, there will be two alternating phases of play:
#### The Task Phase:
- During the task phase, groups of one to three players will
take part in small tasks at the different stations. This could
be booting up a computer, checking the rocket's engines, or
preparing for fuel transfer. During these tasks, a spy (or
multiple) can participate in tasks and cause them to fail by
doing the task wrong. NASA members can still mess up though, so
be careful when placing blame.
- Failed tasks will need to be redone.
- The task phase will usually last between three and five
minutes, but has a strict limit of seven minutes. If any task
phase takes longer than seven minutes, the launch will have to
be delayed and the spies will win.
- The task phase is the perfect time for a spy to place a bomb
on any individual station. These bombs will come in handy later,
for sure.
- If 25% of players are at a single station, they can search for
bombs on this station and remove them. However, if a spy is part
of their group, the spy will cause the bomb to be concealed.
#### The Inspection Phase:
- During the Inspection Phase, 50% of the players will be
selected via vote to be inspected.
- Each player will select three other players. The 50% of players
with the most voted will be inspected.
- Once Inspection selections are complete, a computer report will
be returned stating how many checks failed, indicating to the NASA
members how many of the players in that group were spies.

These two alternating phases of play will occur five times each.
Once five rounds have completed, The Launch will begin.

## The Launch:
Just before The Launch, one lucky (or unlucky) member of NASA's team
will be selected as The Leader. This leader is in charge of making
the most important decision of the game: Who will be placed on the
Mission Control Team?

Using input from everyone playing, The Leader must select everyone who
they think are part of NASA's team, with the exception of two. The Leader
cannot select themself, as they will know that they are on NASA's team, 
and they will leave one other NASA member behind to leave a little bit
of room for error.

Once this team is selected, The Launch will occur. During The Launch, each
selected player will, one by one, give their approval for The Launch
to proceed. If every player on the team is a member of NASA,
congratulations! You've just successfully launched the rocket and
won the game!

However, if there are any Spies among the Mission Control Team, and
if NASA failed to find all of the bombs placed by the Spies during
the task phase, then instead of giving their approval for The Launch
to occur, the spy will set off their planted bombs. If the rocket
blows up, the Spies have won.

If there *is* a Spy on the Mission Control Team but NASA found all of
the planted bombs, then the rocket will not explode and NASA will win.
