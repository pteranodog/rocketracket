# rocket racket
- setting: space race
- NASA = good team
- Russian Spies = bad team
- amount of russian spies is selectable like among us imposters
- should be playable anywhere from 6ish to 40ish players
- anyone can say anything at any time but you can't
  share what's on your screen (ever)

### HOW TO CAUSE PLAYERS TO MOVE AND MINGLE:
- 1 to 3 player smaller tasks prepare the rocket for liftoff
- gather groups of about 50% of players per task for the 5 major tasks
- russian spies can sabatoge any tasks but the large tasks require
  a larger amount of spies
- if too many tasks are sabatoged, it's a premature loss, but the
  threshold should be pretty high. this is what gives spies
  the incentive to actually sabatoge tasks, giving NASA information
- spies are trying to place a bomb on the 5 major stations. only
  one spy is required to place a bomb on a station.
- 15% of NASA members coming together can check for bombs on a single station
  at any time, but if one of them is a spy it will be concealed from all of them.

### 5 MAJOR TASKS:
- calibrate mission control stations
- fill fuel tanks
- start crawler
- pressurize launch tower hydraulics
- suit up astronauts

### use other devices as important parts of gameplay (display only though)
- the rocket - takes care of most important game functions
- mission control room
- fuel tanks
- crawler
- launch platform
- astronaut complex
connect to these devices with a 5 digit code that changes every 10 seconds
this makes sure you have to be actually at the station
stations should be far apart because groups should be seperated

At the end of game, randomly select leader from NASA
leader must use knowledge from everyone involved to select
the amount of NASA minus 2 (minus one because the leader is NASA,
minus another for leeway). Everyone selected will, one by one, select
"go for launch," with all spies sorted to the end for more suspense.
If the spies have successfully planted a bomb without detection, any
spies that are part of the selected team can set it off when it becomes
their turn to "go for launch." This way, NASA can still win if a spy
is selected for the team ONLY if they managed to detect and remove all
bombs placed by spies.
